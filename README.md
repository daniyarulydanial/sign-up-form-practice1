## Overview
Intro component with sign-up form challenge hub. 
Ð¡hallenge is to build out this introductory component and get it looking as close to the design as possible with using CCS and JS.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## Process

First of all we created HTML with semantics and added sign-up form. Then externally linked CSS and JS files to it. In CSS file we tried to add responsive and user-friendly design. And in JS we wrote throw if-else conditions validation for sign-up form.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JS validation


### What we learned


```html
          <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" placeholder="First Name" class="">
          <span class="" id="s-fname"></span>
        </div>
```
```css
input[type=submit]:hover {
  opacity: 0.8;
}
```
```js
form.addEventListener('submit', e=> {
}
```
